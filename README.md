Package Description

This project is a product of the [biocommons](https://biocommons.org/) community.

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils/>
- **Documentation** <https://biocommons.github.io/bioutils/>

## Python Package Installation

Install from PyPI with `pip install bioutils` or `uv pip install bioutils`, then try it:

## Developer Setup

### Install Prerequisites

These tools are required to get started:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Current mechanism for consistent invocation of developer tools.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

#### MacOS or Linux Systems

- [Install brew](https://brew.sh/)
- `brew install git make uv`

#### Linux (Debian-based systems)

You may also install using distribution packages:

    sudo apt install git make

Then install uv using the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### One-time developer setup

Create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, install pre-commit hooks, and install an editable package:

    make devready

### Development

**N.B.** Developers are strongly encouraged to use `make` to invoke tools to
ensure consistency with the CI/CD pipelines.  Type `make` to see a list of
supported targets.  A subset are listed here:

    Â» make
    ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ biocommons conventional make targets ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

    Using these targets promots consistency between local development and ci/cd commands.

    usage: make [target ...]
