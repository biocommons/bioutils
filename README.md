## Developer Setup

### Install Prerequisites

These tools are required to get started:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Current mechanism for consistent invocation of developer tools.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

#### MacOS or Linux Systems

- [Install brew](https://brew.sh/)
- `brew install git make uv`

#### Linux (Debian-based systems)

You may also install using distribution packages:

    sudo apt install git make

Then install uv using the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### One-time developer setup

Create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, install pre-commit hooks, and install an editable package:

    make devready

### Development

**N.B.** Developers are strongly encouraged to use `make` to invoke tools to
ensure consistency with the CI/CD pipelines.  Type `make` to see a list of
supported targets.  A subset are listed here:

    Â» make
    ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ biocommons conventional make targets ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

    Using these targets promots consistency between local development and ci/cd commands.

    usage: make [target ...]

    BASIC USAGE
    help                Display help message

    SETUP, INSTALLATION, PACKAGING
    devready            Prepare local dev env: Create virtual env, install the pre-commit hooks
    build               Build package
    publish             publish package to PyPI

    FORMATTING, TESTING, AND CODE QUALITY
    cqa                 Run code quality assessments
    test                Test the code with pytest

    DOCUMENTATION
    docs-serve          Build and serve the documentation
    docs-test           Test if documentation can be built without warnings or errors

    CLEANUP
    clean               Remove temporary and backup files
    cleaner             Remove files and directories that are easily rebuilt
