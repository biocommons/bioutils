"""Provides utilities for interconverting between coordinate systems
especially as used by the hgvs code.  The three systems are:

.. parsed-literal::
                  : A : C : G : T : A : C :
  human/hgvs  h   :-3 :-2 :-1 : 1 : 2 : 3 :
  continuous  c   :-2 :-1 : 0 : 1 : 2 : 3 :
  interbase   i  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3

Human/hgvs coordinates are the native coordinates used by the HGVS
recommendations. The coordinates are 1-based, inclusive, and refer to
the nucleotides; there is no 0.

Continuous coordinates are similar to hgvs coordinates, but adds 1 to
all negative values so that there is no discontinuity between -1 and 1
(as there is with HGVS).

Interbase coordinates refer to the zero-width junctions between
nucleotides.  The main advantage of interbase coordinates is that
there are no corner cases in the specification of intervals used for
insertions and deletions as there is with numbering systems that refer
to nucleotides themselves.  Numerically, interbase intervals are
0-based, left-closed, and right-open.  Beacuse referring to a single
interbase coordinate is not particularly meaningful, interbase
coordinates are always passed as start,end pairs.

Because it's easy to confuse these coordinates in code, ``_h``, ``_c``, and ``_i``
suffixes are often used to clarify variables.

For code clarity, this module provides functions that interconvert
*intervals* specified in each of the coordinate systems.
